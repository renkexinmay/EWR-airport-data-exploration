Created by [Kexin Ren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kexinren/) at University of Alberta, Canada in 2016 - 2017.

### Introduction
Tool: R
Techniques: Unsupervised learning (Autoencoders), clustering, statistical Analysis (Configural Frequency Analysis, CFA)

#### Description: explore the patterns of massive evolved air program (GDP) data
- preprocessed the discrete data into evolving forms
- visualized the parameters and time stamps of the programs
- reduced dimension (598 dim to 2 dim) using autoencoders
- clustered the self-created images
- analyzed the clusters using stat methods
